# HOW PRODUCTION FONTS ARE COUNTED:

The maximum defined under License Usage per Term refers to the amount of Font Software and thus, Production Fonts shall be counted by individual digital files which can be used for the licensed deployment, not typeface families (for example, Helvetica Now, Arial), a typeface or a category of typefaces. E.g. “Helvetica Now Text Regular,” “Helvetica Now Text Bold,” and “Helvetica Now Text Bold Italic” would count as three Production Fonts.

Individual Font Software (e.g. variable Font Software or Font Software with Chinese or Japanese language extensions) may count as a multiple of one Production Font against your account. The factor will be communicated when you choose the Font Software as a Production Font and visible in your Monotype Fonts Platform Account.

Any Font Software listed in the Order Form as “Add-On Font Software” shall automatically count as Production Fonts.

You may swap all of or part of your Production Fonts one (1) time per calendar quarter by removing Font Software as a Production Font and choosing other Font Software on the Monotype Fonts Platform.

All formats (for example OTF, WOFF) of the same Production Font shall count as one Production Font.

In the event your Use of the Font Software exceeds the licensed amounts in the Order Form, you agree to license from Monotype the necessary additional amounts and pay any fee associated with such increase. Monotype makes available to you technology that will allow you to track (and automatically report to Monotype) the number of Page Views and Impressions generated by your Use of the Font Software. Page View and Impression tracking is automatically included if you host the Font Software for Page Views or Impressions via the Monotype Fonts Platform. If you choose to self-host the Font Software, use of Monotype’s tracking technology is not required.

Monotype will provide, by email to your Primary Licensed Monotype Fonts User(s) on a quarterly basis, a list of Font Software which has been downloaded from the Monotype Fonts Platform by your Licensed Monotype Fonts Users. Within twenty-one (21) days of the date of such list, you must report to Monotype which Font Software has been used as a Production Font, in the form and format requested by Monotype. If you believe you have been presented with an inaccurate list of downloaded Font Software, you should contact Monotype prior to the conclusion of the 21 days to dispute accuracy of the list. If you have not reported back to us within 21 days, we will assume all Font Software downloaded from the Monotype Fonts Platform has been used as Production Fonts. If the amount of Production Fonts exceeds the maximum number of Production Fonts you have licensed, you agree to license from Monotype the necessary amounts and pay any fee associated with such increase. Monotype reserves the right to suspend access to the Monotype Fonts Platform at its discretion in the event of any use of the Monotype Fonts Platform or the Font Software by you outside of the terms of this Agreement which is revealed in reporting.

In addition to a decision by either party to not renew this Agreement upon the expiration of the Term, the parties shall have the right to terminate the Agreement only as set forth in this Section 6.

Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party if the nonnotifying party has breached this Agreement, and such breach has not been cured within that thirty (30) day period. Any such notice shall set forth the breach or breaches and the actions necessary to cure them, if a cure is possible.

The rights of a recipient of a Licensed Application or a Licensed Commercial Electronic Document generated pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement. All other license rights granted to you in this Agreement shall end with the termination of this Agreement.
