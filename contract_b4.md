Monotype Fonts Service and License Terms (Design and Deploy).

the licensed deployment, not typeface families (for example, Helvetica Now, Arial), a typeface  
or a category of typefaces. E.g. “Helvetica Now Text Regular,” “Helvetica Now Text Bold,”  
and “Helvetica Now Text Bold Italic” would count as three Production Fonts.  
Individual Font Software (e.g. variable Font Software or Font Software with Chinese or  
Japanese language extensions) may count as a multiple of one Production Font against your  
account. The factor will be communicated when you choose the Font Software as a  
Production Font and visible in your Monotype Fonts account.  
All formats (for example OTF, WOFF) of the same Production Font shall count as one  
Production Font. The maximum licensed in your Order Form is cumulative for the entire

5. EXCEEDING LICENSED USAGE OF THE FONT SOFTWARE; REPORTING YOUR USAGE OF THE FONT  
## SOFTWARE AS PRODUCTION FONT(S).

You have licensed rights in this Agreement to the Font Software that may be subject to certain limitations in  
volume. Monotype makes available to you technology that will allow you to track (and automatically report to  
Monotype) the number of Page Views and Impressions generated by your Use of the Font Software. When you  
host the Font Software for Page Views or Impressions via Monotype Fonts, the use of the technology is not  
optional. If you choose to self-host the Font Software for Page Views and Impressions and do not elect to use this  
tracking technology and with regard to other limitations in volume such as the number of Workstations using the  
Font Software, the number of Mobile Applications or the number of Commercial Electronic Documents with  
embedded Font Software or the number of Servers used pursuant to Section 2.B.iv. Servers, Monotype has the  
right to ask you, from time to time, to provide information regarding such limitations (namely the number of  
Workstations, Mobile Applications, Commercial Electronic Documents, Servers, Page Views, and/or Impressions)  
and you are obligated to maintain records with respect to such usage and to provide us with that information within  
30 days of our request. In the event your Use of the Font Software exceeds the licensed limited amount, you agree  
to license from Monotype the necessary additional amounts and pay any fee associated with such increase.  
Monotype will provide, by email to your Primary Licensed Monotype Fonts User(s) on a quarterly basis, a list of  
Font Software which has been downloaded from Monotype Fonts by your Licensed Monotype Fonts Users. Within  
twenty-one (21) days of the date of such list, you must report to Monotype which Font Software has been used as  
a Production Font, in the form and format requested by Monotype. If you believe you have been presented with an  
inaccurate list of downloaded Font Software, you should contact Monotype prior to the conclusion of the 21 days to  
dispute accuracy of the list. If you have not reported back to us within 21 days, we will assume all Font Software  
downloaded from Monotype Fonts has been used as Production Fonts. If the amount of Production Fonts exceeds  
the maximum number of Production Fonts you have licensed, you agree to license from Monotype the necessary  
amounts and pay any fee associated with such increase. Monotype reserves the right to suspend access to  
Monotype Fonts at its discretion in the event of any use of Monotype Fonts or the Font Software by you outside of  
the terms of this Agreement which is revealed in reporting.  
## 6. TERMINATION.

In addition to a decision by either party to not renew this Agreement upon the expiration of the Term, the parties shall  
have the right to terminate the Agreement only as set forth in this Section 6.  
Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party if the non-  
notifying party has breached this Agreement, and such breach has not been cured within that thirty (30) day period.  
Any such notice shall set forth the breach or breaches and the actions necessary to cure them, if a cure is possible.  
The rights of a recipient of a Licensed Mobile Application or a Licensed Commercial Electronic Document generated  
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement. All other license rights granted to you in  
this Agreement shall end with the termination of this Agreement.  
The termination of this Agreement shall not preclude either party from suing the other party for damages of any  
breach of the Agreement.  
If this Agreement expires at the conclusion of its then-current term without being renewed by either party or is  
terminated by either party for any reason, and you request to reinstate such agreement, Monotype may, in its sole  
discretion, agree to allow such reinstatement. In case of a reinstatement, Monotype reserves the right to charge you  
a one-time additional fee of twenty percent (20%) of the last annual term fee due under the agreement, which shall  
be due upon execution of such reinstatement.
